## What is AssaultCube?
AssaultCube is a **FREE**, multiplayer, first-person shooter game, based on the
[CUBE engine](http://cubeengine.com/cube.php4).

Taking place in realistic environments, with fast, arcade gameplay,
it's addictive and fun!

With efficient bandwidth usage, it's low-latency and can even run over a 56 Kbps
connection. It's tiny too, weighing in at a lightweight about 50 MB package
available for [Windows](https://github.com/assaultcube/AC/releases/download/v1.2.0.2/AssaultCube_v1.2.0.2.exe), [Mac](https://github.com/assaultcube/AC/releases/download/v1.2.0.2/AssaultCube_v1.2.0.2.dmg) and [Linux](https://github.com/assaultcube/AC/releases/download/v1.2.0.2/AssaultCube_v1.2.0.2.tar.bz2). On the correct settings, it can even run
on old hardware (Pentium III and above).
