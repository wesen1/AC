Tips for compiling AssaultCube in Xcode:

1. For “assaultcube” scheme/target:
a) set “Release-Deployment” as configuration to build, in menu Product > Edit Scheme > Run > Build Configuration
b) set 64-bit architecture in menu Product > Destination
2. Build “assaultcube” scheme for "Release-Deployment" configuration, in result the package assaultcube.dmg will be created in subfolder under /private/var/root/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/

Note:
Assaultcube for Mac uses original 64-bit frameworks of SDL2, SDL2_image and from SDL2_mixer: Ogg and Vorbis, therefore has to be compiled as 64-bit.
Self-compiled 32-bit frameworks are needed for potential custom compiling for 32-bit Mac.
Launcher has to be compiled as 32-bit, otherwise it won't start nowadays.
